CollaborateEd: Student Collaboration and Project Hub

Project Overview

CollaborateEd is a lightweight, real-time web-based platform designed specifically for students to manage and execute team projects effectively. It aims to solve common challenges in student collaboration, such as scattered communication, poor task tracking, and lack of accountability.

This application is built using HTML, CSS (via Tailwind CDN), and Vanilla JavaScript, with Firebase Firestore integrated for real-time data handling.

🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites

You need a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) and a code editor like VS Code.

Running the Application

Since this is a single-page HTML application using only frontend technologies:

Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/CollaborateEd.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/CollaborateEd.git)
cd CollaborateEd


Open in Browser:

Find the index.html file in the root directory.

Right-click on index.html and choose "Open with Live Server" (if using the VS Code extension) OR simply drag the file into your web browser.

The application will load and automatically simulate the authentication required for the Collaborative Canvas environment. Click "Log In (Simulated)" to access the Dashboard.

🛠️ Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS (via CDN), Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

Database (Mocked): Firebase Firestore (configured in the <script type="module"> block for real-time data examples).

Icons: Lucide Icons

🤝 Contribution

If you plan to collaborate, please ensure you maintain the single-file structure (index.html) or agree on a standard for separating the CSS and JavaScript into external files later.
